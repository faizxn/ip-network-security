 # ipsec: ipsec is a group of protocols that are used together to set up encrypted connections between device.
        it helps keep data secure sent over public networks. its often used to set up VPN.
		it works by encrypting IP packets along with authenticating the source where the packets come from.
				
	VPN logins are usually password-based. users require application.
	IPsec protocols add several headers and trailers to packets. either the MSS and MTU have used to be adjusted.	

    MTU for a network is 1500 bytes.. a IP header is 20 bytes long .. a TCP header is  20 bytes long.. 1460 bytes of payload.
	however ipsec adds an authentication header.. an esp header and associated trailers. These add 50-60 bytes to a packet, or more..

	
 #IPsec tunnel mode and IPsec transport mode:

	+ tunnel mode,  both ip header and payload is encrypted.  new ip packet encapsulates the encrypted one with a new header that is used for routing decisions.	
	+ transport mode, only ip payload is encrypted. but ip header is not encrypted. orginal ip header is used for routing decisions. 
	
	
	
 # protocols are used in IPsec:

      + AH: The AH protocol ensures that data packets are from a trusted source and that the data has not been tampered with from attackers.
	  + ESP: ESP encrypts the IP header and the payload for each packet.
	  + SA (security association): SA refers to a number of protocols used for negotiating encryption keys and algorithms. One of the most common SA protocols is Internet Key Exchange (IKE).

	
 # ipsec connection works:

		+ key-exchange: keys are necessary for encryption. key is a string of random characters that can be used to encrypt and decrypt message.
		
		+ packet headers and trailers: all data that is sent over a network is broken down into smaller pieces called packets. packets contain payload.
		ipsec adds several headers to data packets containing authentication and encryption information.

		+ authentication: ipsec provides authentication for each packet.		
		+ encryption: ipsec encrypts the payloads. 
		
		+ transmission: encrypted ipsec packets travel across one or more networks to their destination using a transport protocol.
		decryption: at the other end of the communication. the packets are decrypted.

  #IPSec#
  
  IPSec Protocol 		: ESP, AH, ESP+AH
  Encrption 	 		: DES, 3DES, AES
  Authentication 		: MD5, SHA
  DH (Diffie-Hellman)		: DH-1,2,5
  
  IKE phase 1 - two peers will negotiate about the encryption, authentication, hashing and other protocols. 

	IKE phase 1 can operate in two modes: main mode and aggressive mode

	+Main Mode: IKEv1 main mode uses 6 (six) messages.
	+Aggressive mode	: IKEv1 aggressive mode only requires 3 (three) messages to establish the security associatio	

  IKE Phase 2 - will be actually used to protect user data. There is only one mode to build the IKE phase 2 tunnel which is called quick mode.
  
  
  Hashing: we use a hashing algorithm to verify the integrity, we use MD5 or SHA for this.
  Authentication: each peer has to prove who he is. Two commonly used options are a pre-shared key or digital certificates.
  Encryption: what algorithm do we use for encryption? For example, DES, 3DES or AES.
  DH Group: The DH group determines the strength of the key that is used in the key exchange process. 
					The higher group numbers are more secure but take longer to compute.
  Lifetime: a common default value is 86400 seconds (1 day).
  SA (Security Association) : is collection of parameters that the two devices will use.
													
								Destination Address
								Security Parameter Index (SPI)
								Key
								Additional SA Attributes (One day or 100MB)

SPI (Security Parameter Index), this is a unique value that identifies this security association.

  AH and ESP: both offer authentication and integrity but only ESP supports encryption. Because of this, ESP is the most popular choice nowadays.
	
	Both protocols support two different modes-
  
			+Transport mode
			+Tunnel mode
