Cisco IPS sensors can operate in either Promiscuous or Inline modes.. 
	The decision on what mode to use depends on many considerations of network.. 
	
	When deployed in Promiscuous Mode, it captures the traffic for the sensor and forwards a copy for analysis..
		It can detect an attack and send an alert. But  it does not prevent the attack..


	To deploy in inline mode, you need to configure the sensor as a transparent Layer 2 device that passes traffic..
		It can block malicious traffic.. 

	Keep in mind that a sensor could be configured inline..
	
	
IPS Version 7.0 software permits a device to do promiscuous mode and inline mode simultaneously..
	which allows some segments to be monitored for IDS only while other segments use IPS protection..
